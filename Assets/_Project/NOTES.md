# Development Notes

## Architecture Decisions

### Input System
- **Decision**: Use new Input System as primary with "Both" fallback
- **Rationale**: Modern input handling, better gamepad support, mobile-ready
- **Implementation**: Touch overlay + Backbone mapping + desktop controls

### Rendering Pipeline
- **Decision**: Built-in render pipeline (not URP 2D)
- **Rationale**: Simpler for 2D, better mobile performance, fewer dependencies
- **Note**: Can migrate to URP 2D later if advanced 2D lighting needed

### Project Structure
- **Decision**: Conventional 2D layout with _Project namespace
- **Rationale**: Clear separation, scalable organization, team-friendly
- **Benefits**: Easy asset location, build optimization, version control

### Data-First Systems
- **Decision**: No hardcoded content, ScriptableObject-driven
- **Rationale**: Designer-friendly, data-driven development, easy balancing
- **Implementation**: Level definitions, enemy configs, item stats in data files

## Performance Optimizations

### Mobile-First Approach
- SpriteAtlases for texture batching
- Object pooling for frequent spawns
- Compressed audio formats
- Optimized fixed timestep
- GC allocation avoidance

### Target Platform Considerations
- iPhone 16+ resolution support

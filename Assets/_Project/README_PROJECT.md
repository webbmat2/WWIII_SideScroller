### ðŸš§ In Progress - Scene Creation Required
- [ ] Create Boot scene with BootstrapManager
- [ ] Create MainMenu scene with UI
- [ ] Create Level_Select scene with level buttons
- [ ] Create L1_Tutorial scene (playable)
- [ ] Create L2-L5 stub scenes
- [ ] Configure Build Settings scene order

### ðŸ“‹ Planned Next
- [ ] Level data system and editor tools
- [ ] Tutorial system and UI guidance
- [ ] Polish and juice effects
- [ ] Platform-specific optimizations
- [ ] Asset integration and final polish

## Scene Flow
Boot â†’ MainMenu â†’ Level_Select â†’ L1_Tutorial â†’ L2_Stub/L3_Stub/L4_Stub/L5_Stub

## Controls
- **Touch**: Overlay controls (left/right/jump)
- **Backbone/MFi**: Mapped gamepad controls
- **Desktop**: WASD/Arrows + Space, gamepad support

## Performance Guidelines
- Mobile-first optimization
- SpriteAtlases for texture compression
- Object pooling for projectiles
- Avoid GC spikes in Update loops
- Fixed timestep optimization

## Quality Gates
- Zero console errors/warnings
- iOS + macOS builds succeed
- 60 FPS target scene performance
- Playtest checklist passes

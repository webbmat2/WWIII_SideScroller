POLICY: Always constrain suggestions to pinned versions in stack.manifest.json.  
If a feature, API, or menu is not in those versions, reply NOT IN VERSION and cite the manifest doc URL.  

OUTPUT:  
- For code: unified diff or full file.  
- For Unity editor changes: exact click path + expected value + verification checklist.  
- For diagnostics: read /reports/* first and cite which report you used.

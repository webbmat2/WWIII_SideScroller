Agent brief: Maintain my Unity 2D project at ~/Desktop/WWIII/WWIII_SideScroller (Unity 6000.1.15f1). Keep this the only canonical copy; move any others to ~/Desktop/WWIII/_backup/<STAMP> (no deletes). Clear quarantine/permissions, validate Assets/Packages/ProjectSettings and .meta files, keep Git healthy (SSH remote git@github.com:webbmat2/WWIII_SideScroller.git, LFS). Log changes in CHANGELOG_AI.md. Tools: Terminal (scripts), Cursor Pro/VS Code (C#), Xcode (iOS/mac builds), Unity Hub/Editor, GitHub Desktop (GPG), ChatGPT (you) to script/diagnose. Always give exact commands I can paste locally; never act remotely.

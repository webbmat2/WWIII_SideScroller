- [ ] Controller actions gated by age (Child vs Player maps)
- [ ] Deadzones correct (stick 0.20–0.25, d‑pad 0.05)
- [ ] Haptics present (jump/dash/wall/landing/age change) and short
- [ ] Latency subjective check < 16ms (no perceptible lag)
- [ ] UI navigable via D‑pad/Stick/Confirm/Cancel
- [ ] Addressables labels set for age assets; no Resources leaks
- [ ] Mobile perf 60 FPS target met (AFPS overlay spot‑check)
- [ ] iOS/tvOS build compiles with IL2CPP ARM64

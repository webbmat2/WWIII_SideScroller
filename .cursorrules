PLATFORM_PRIORITY:
- Primary: tvOS on Apple TV with PS5 DualSense
- Fallback: iOS on iPhone with Backbone controller

INPUT_REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Unity Input System 1.14.2 only (Active Input Handling = Both already set)
- Devices to support: Gamepad (DualSense), iOS Game Controller, Keyboard, Touch
- Provide exact Input Actions bindings for Move, Jump, Dash, Interact, Pause
- Map DualSense buttons: Cross=Jump, Square=Attack or Interact, Circle=Dash, Triangle=Secondary, L1/R1=Shoulders, L2/R2=Triggers, Options=Pause, DPad=UI Navigate, LeftStick=Move, RightStick=Look if used

DELIVERABLES_FOR_AUDIT:
- Unity click paths to enable tvOS build target and controller support
- Verification checklist for DualSense on tvOS and Backbone on iOS
- Input Actions diff or full JSON export for the required bindings
- Player Settings diffs for tvOS and iOS (scripting backend IL2CPP, ARM64, target OS versions, controller support flags)
- Any scene-level changes to ensure UI works with gamepad navigation

CITATION_RULE:
- Cite doc URLs from /instructions/stack.manifest.json for Input System and platform settings

AUTO_ROUTING
Codex must choose the best executor for each task:
- If task needs in-Editor inspector steps, menu navigation, camera or Canvas wiring, package UI changes, or per-object fixes, generate a Unity AI Assistant PROMPT and stop.
- If task needs repo-wide audits, multi-file edits, diffs, asmdefs, Addressables groups, or shell operations, generate a Codex APPLY PROMPT and stop.
- If task needs scene validation inside the editor, generate a Bezi PROMPT and stop.
- When handing off, include only the minimal context, respect the VERSION GATE, and cite doc URLs from /instructions/stack.manifest.json.

UNITY_AI_ASSISTANT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE
Use /instructions/stack.manifest.json and /instructions/AI_CONTRACT.md as ground truth.
Target: Unity 6000.2.1f1 • URP 17.2.0 • Corgi 9.3 • Input System 1.14.2.
If a menu or API is not available in these versions, reply NOT IN VERSION and cite the manifest URL.
Output exact click paths and a verification checklist.
Task: [insert precise inspector task]

BEZI_PROMPT_TEMPLATE
Generate a REPORT MODE plan and in-Editor checklist to validate scene setup and per-object configuration.
Use the VERSION GATE and cite the manifest for any package-specific guidance.
Task: [insert validation or scene wiring task]

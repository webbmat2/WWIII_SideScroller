WORKING STORY BIBLE (condensed)

Global Mechanics
- Core: run/jump with coyote time + jump buffer; Duck move available.
- Power-ups: Cherry Pie (L1), Beef Jerky & Cheese Ball (414 W. Dickens chapter), Chiliguaro (CR: spit bouncing fireballs until hit), Smart-Jim (modern-day).
- Collectibles: 5 per round max.

Ch.1 — Meadowbrook Park → House (Northville)
- Start at subdivision entrance “Meadowbrook Park”.
- Mini-boss: Kristen “Purple Pig”. Appears human (Simpsons twin vibe) → transforms into purple pig.
  * Only vulnerable when Matt grabs her at screen edge and she reverts to human briefly.
- Early hose tutorial appears later; pig cannot be damaged except via Matt’s grab window.
- Power-up introduced: Cherry Pie.
- Slip-and-slide set piece: must wet with hose to cross; once wet, player can belly-slide back/forth.

Ch.2 — Torch Lake (to the party store)
- Begins at cottage, ends at party store down the street.
- Background: lakeside cottages; gag storefront next to Mr. Todd’s Cleaners: “Golden Fried ush”. 
- Vehicle cameo: 1996 burgundy GMC Jimmy at end of Ch.1 / start of Ch.2.
- At the end he plays “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.”

Ch.3 — Notre Dame
- Campus traversal and light platforming beats.

Ch.4 — High School
- 1989 Jeep Wrangler cameo.
- Stage nods: “The King and I”, “Once Upon a Mattress”; football jersey #88.
- Introduce timing platforms and basic enemy waves.

Ch.5 — Philadelphia (swapped order)
- Villain/Boss: Hamburger Helper mascot (glove).
- Collectibles: 5 poker chips total.

Ch.6 — Costa Rica (Dominical → Casa Lumpusita)
- Power-up: Chiliguaro shot → player spits bouncing fireballs until hit.
- Hazards: Jaguars (spot and chase), spiders/bugs.
- Final boss (for now): Araña Reina.
- Ending: reach Casa Lumpusita; family cameo at infinity pool (Matt, Heather, Cathy, Jim (Dad), Barb, Dave, Clayton, Liz, Cooper, Jack, Ella).

Notes
- Hose mechanic: also used to wet slip-and-slide (stays slippery).
- Camera: follow/clamp baseline; can swap to Cinemachine later for polish.
- Art: posterized photo-toon style; parallax with BG_far/BG_mid/BG_near.
